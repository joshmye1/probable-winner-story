Right after Jack woke up, he picked up his phone to check the time. It read 10:30. He had a class at 11:00 and still had plenty of time to get ther if he left soon. For a while, he considered skipping but realized that he had to go in order to turn in his homework. He quickly got ready and then left to go to class.
He went to the class, had a group discussion in the beginning and later submitted his homework. Jack is on his way back to his apartment after completing the class, he then saw a poster saying online applications for football team 2020 are open. His excitement levels are on cloud nine and right after he reached home, he started looking for the application online.
He got back to his room, and realized that he had left his laptop at home. "Back to the computer lab," he thought. He logged on and searched around the UW-Madison pages, and realized he had 10 assignments, 4 midterms, and a 50 page essay singled spaced he had to write for tomorrow. What is Jack supposed to do? He tries to email his professors to give him an extension, but the professor shrugs it off, saying "just deal with it like all the other students". He started to work like a madman, not resting or eating until the next morning. He had finally finished what he thought to be a masterpiece, and submitted it online. Whoops, that was the recruitment link for the football team.
