Right after Jack woke up, he picked up his phone to check the time. It read 10:30. He had a class at 11:00 and still had plenty of time to get ther if he left soon. For a while, he considered skipping but realized that he had to go in order to turn in his homework. He quickly got ready and then left to go to class.
He went to the class, had a group discussion in the beginnings and later submitted his homework. Jack is on his way back to his apartment after completing the class, he then saw a poster saying online applications for football team 2020 are open. His excitement levels are on cloud nine and right after he reached home, he started looking for the application online.
