Right after Jack woke up, he picked up his phone to check the time. It read 10:30. He had a class at 11:00 and still had plenty of time to get ther if he left soon. For a while, he considered skipping but realized that he had to go in order to turn in his homework. He quickly got ready and then left to go to class.
